Toy log distributed-system with Go using mTLS, Serf

This repository is for learning how to build distributed systems.
I followed the book [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/).
I decided to avoid using gRPC and the Raft consensus algorithm.

- Step1 simple JSON over HTTP Server
- Step2 mTLS
- Step3 Service Discovery with Serf
